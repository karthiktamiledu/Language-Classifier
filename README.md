# Language-Classifier
A Language Classification Machine Learning Project

This project is an exploration of using Machine Learning to classify the language of a text. It explores the various models and tunings that can be used to achieve this. 

There are several files in this repository:
- 11_13 uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, run once, with a report consisting of a Single score
- 11_15 uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes model and applies Logistic Regression, run 99 times and averaged, with a report consisting of the Multinomial Naive Bayes score + LR prediction
- 11_16 uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes model and applies Logistic Regression, run 99 times and averaged, with a report consisting of the Multinomial Naive Bayes score only
- 11_17 uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, adding Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors, run 19 times and averaged, with a Classification report
- 11_22 uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, adding Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression Classifier, run 19 times and averaged, with the feature of SelectPercentile chi2, and a Classification report
